    <h1><a href='../index.html'>brewtool</a></h1>
    <h2>by Andrew G. Crowell</h2>
    <p>A collection of primitive editor/converter tools for making assets used with homebrew ROM development. These are going to be mashed together pretty haphazardly. The goal is low-effort UI that just gets the job done.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href='chr/index.html'>CHR Tool</a> &mdash; For viewing .chr files, as well as importing/exporting low-color images</li>
    </ul>
