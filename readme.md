brewtool
========

*by Andrew G. Crowell (Overkill)*

A collection of primitive editor/converter tools for making assets used with homebrew ROM development. These are going to be mashed together pretty haphazardly. The goal is low-effort UI that just gets the job done.

At the very least serves as a nice replacement for YY-CHR.
